Premise

California is the world leader in AI research and deployment, and now—more than ever—people are looking over their shoulder, wondering if a bot is about to take their job. We need to act now, set the tone, and show how the gains from AI can be shared with everyone, not just the biggest balance sheets.

Many folks shout “Let’s slap an AI Tax on it!”—but the minute you try to define AI, the wheels fall off. Is it the smart thermostat that shaves a few degrees? Grammarly fixing commas? GPT writing half this email? Where do we draw the line?

Instead of chasing definitions, let’s talk economics. AI and automation = revenue not driven by human labor. In California-speak, that’s revenue earned without paying Californians. So let’s tax the economic output, not the buzzword.

We can keep it simple with a Revenue Tax on gross receipts—the same broad base other states and countries already use—but dial it in so it rewards local wages. It's a win-win.  Done right, it could be a PR win for AI and a roadmap for the broader future as AI integrated deeper into our lives.  We should align AI and automation as a benefactor for us all.

The Quick Pitch
1.      0.5 % gross-receipts skim on every California dollar a business rings up.

2.      Wage rebate:
 * * 1 % back on every CA payroll dollar. ( 2x the revenue tax )
 * * 3 % back when that dollar goes to someone re-entering the workforce (parent, mom, dad, veteran, grad, student, sabbatical return, unhoused, etc). [6x the revenue tax]

3.      Mom-and-Pop/ Main St. Shield: If annual CA revenue ≤ $5 M, apply the state 7.25 % sales tax you already collect—bill drops to zero. (could become a progressive scale )

Net result: could reach $10 B a year. Big, low-labor firms foot most of the bill; small, payroll-heavy shops feel nothing.

Why It Works (plain-speak)
*         Bots can’t hide revenue. Skimming gross receipts catches every automated dollar before it can be hidden as an expense.

*         Paychecks erase the tax. Hire or give raises → your bill shrinks automatically.

*         No double-tax pain. Corner stores under $5 M already send in sales tax—now that wipes their slate clean.

*         Big Tech can automate all it wants. Just share 0.5 % of the upside or recycle that cash into CA wages.  Aligns AI Growth, with Wage Growth ( already taxed )


There are so many ways to grow capital, and AI adds to the list.  Just add the number of bots, machines, or robots you need to get a job done. It's a force multiplier; it's possible to imagine companies in the future that don't have any employees at all.  Between AI and Crypto Smart Contracts, people are certainly trying.  This is about creating a playbook to rebalance the equation and to create a fair playing field for everyone.  We don't yet have an abundant society where everything is free; we might never get there. So, until that day, people need jobs and a good wage.  It's ethical to encourage paying a fair wage, but that's not what we do now.

Wages and personal income support the majority of tax revenue. If someone makes $100k a year, they don't get to spend $100k; $20- 40k comes off the top and goes towards taxes, income taxes.  On top of that, their employer pays employment taxes and benefits.  So, for a person to have $70k to spend, $50-70k is spent on taxes and benefits (it's probably worse than that).

By contrast, AI (and automation ) is a tax write-off. Companies can subscribe to AI services or buy AI hardware. So, every dollar they spend on AI is not only a direct investment in enhancing the company's productivity, but they also get to deduct those expenses from their income TAX-FREE.

This is why we need to do something now.  As AI and Automation will only accelerate, not only does it have intrinsic advantages over labor hours, but it has HUGE tax advantages.

AI and Automation don't pay taxes, don't need health care, and don't need a retirement plan.  So, currently, every dollar spent on AI is worth at least $1.28 in tax savings alone.  While each dollar spent paying wages is less than $.50 in economic value for the employee.

This is how the system is rigged against people and a meaningful wage.

We can change this, skip the complex definitions, and build a tax framework for the future.  We can build a tax framework that taxes AI and incentivises new wages.  Over time, this framework could be rebalanced to further encourage wages.  Imagine being able to reduce employment taxes further to incentivise hiring, or to reduce earned income taxes to give people a raise on their hard work.

I believe this is a good starting point, and I'm excited to see how you can evolve this concept over time.  Maybe we could leverage these ideas in other states or even nationally.  We need to start somewhere, and San Francisco, California, is probably the best place to start thinking about solutions for this.  Having a concrete example and data on how this rebalances the incentives back towards wages would be amazing.

I am happy to come in and chat about more of the ideas I have circulating around why this is a good idea.  I hope this is enough to get you and your team inspired.

There is so much more than could be said, but this is just the start.
